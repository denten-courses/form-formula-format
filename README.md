## Course Description

Topics in Literary Theory is a course meant to address a range of key concepts
related to the contemporary study of literature and textuality, including
ideas about form, figure, trope, narrative, discourse, interpretation, genre,
period, value, canon, archive, influence, authorship, readership, and
reception of literary texts.

In this semester's seminar we will cover the major literary, philosophical,
and theoretical works related to the long history of formalism. Canonical
texts in aesthetic theory from Plato, Hegel, Herder, Lessing, Shklovsky, Roman
Jakobson, Leon Trotsky, Percy Lubbock, W.M. Wimsatt, Roland Barthes,
Lévi-Strauss, Claude Frederic Jameson, Terry Eagleton, and Susan Sontag will
lead us to a more recent body of work from media theorists, literary scholars,
and computer scientists including Jean Baudrillard, Alexander Galloway, Sharon
Marcus, Caroline Levine, Kathleen McKeown, Donald Knuth, Marjorie Levinson,
Franco Moretti, and Johanna Drucker.

Two rich intellectual histories will collide in these readings: one, the
intellectual history of form in literary theory and the other, the material
history of formats as a concept in textual criticism, book history, and
software design. Format will emerge as a concept that mediates between form
understood as internal "rules for construction" and form understood as
"external shape." The formatting layer transforms one type of structure, a
series of bits arranged into tracks and sectors, into another, letters
arranged into sentences and paragraphs. We will draw a history of text formats
that commences with several "control characters" limited in function to
actions like "carriage return" or "stop transmission." With time, the
formatting layer will encompass all manner of machine instruction, including
structures of governance like "digital rights management" and "copy
protection." A manufacturer's ability to censor or to surveil electronic books
is contained within the formatting layer. The concept of formatting developed
in this course is critical therefore to our understanding the capabilities of
digital texts: from electronic books that modify themselves to suit the
reader's geographic location, gender, or socio-economic status to "smart"
contracts that contain the rules of their own execution.

## Course Requirements & Grading

Students will be expected to read the approximate equivalent of three
scholarly articles per week, to attend the seminar weekly, to participate in
the class discussion both in person and online, and to develop a research
project that will culminate in a paper. Advanced students will have the option
to integrate the course's themes with the subject matter of their expertise.

| Class participation                      | 25%  |
|------------------------------------------|------|
| Informal weekly response online forum    | 25%  |
| Midterm project proposal                 | 20%  |
| Final paper                              | 30%  |

## University Policies

When in doubt, cite! Plagiarism is insulting to your fellow students, your
instructors, and to the research community at large. It wastes my time and
yours, and is, ultimately, not worth the risk. Consult Culumbia’s guidelines
at <http://www.college.columbia.edu/academics/integrity> or ask me for help
early in the writing process.
