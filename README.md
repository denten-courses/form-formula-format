## Course Description

In this graduate seminar we will cover the major literary, philosophical, and
theoretical texts related to the long history of formalism. Canonical texts in
aesthetic theory from Plato, Hegel, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Viktor Shklovsky,
Roman Jakobson, Leon Trotsky, Percy Lubbock, W.M. Wimsatt, Renee Wellek,
Roland Barthes, Paul De Man, Frederic Jameson, Terry Eagleton, Geoffrey
Hartman, and Susan Sontag will lead us to a more recent body of work from
media theorists, literary scholars, and computer scientists including
Alexander Galloway, Sharon Marcus, Caroline Levine, Kathleen McKeown, Donald
Knuth, Alan Liu, Marjorie Levinson, Franco Moretti, and Johanna Drucker.

Throughout the course we will explore the fundamental tension in the very idea
of form
